## Getting Started: Web

### How to learn with a WepSIM example

+ Please, follow these these steps:

  1. First, we need to load WepSIM in your favorite web browser. Then click on the Examples button to open the Examples dialog:
    ![screen:example1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/simulator/simulator021.jpg)
  2. In the Examples dialog please click on the colored 'title' of the example and WepSIM will load and compile the associated microcode and assembly code:
    ![screen:example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/simulator/simulator022.jpg)
  3. In the simulator workspace you can execute step by step and analyze the state of the components. It is possible to work both, at assembly level or at microcode level: 
    ![screen:simulation1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/welcome/simulation_xinstruction.gif)


### How to modify an existing example or build your own

+ The typical workflow consists in the following steps:

   1. First, we need to load WepSIM in your web browser. Then you should go to the microcode editor workspace:
     ![screen:firmware1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/simulator/firmware001.jpg)
   2. You can load an existing microcode or edit a new one. You have to microcompile the microcode to load the binary into the CPU's control memory:
     ![screen:firmware2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/simulator/firmware002.jpg)
   3. Next, you could go to the assembly editor workspace. In the editor workspace you can load an existing assembly code or edit a new one:
     ![screen:firmware3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/simulator/assembly002b.jpg)
   4. The instructions set defined in the previous microcode is used to create your assembly code. You have to compile the assembly code to load the binary into the main memory:
     ![screen:assembly1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/simulator/assembly003.jpg)
   5. Finally, go back to the simulator workspace, and you can execute step by step and analyze the state of the components.
     It is possible to work at assembly level or at microcode level: 
     ![screen:simulation cpu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/welcome/simulation_xinstruction.gif)


### WepSIM configuration 

+ From the general toolbar, the configuration button allows users to personalize several options:
  ![screen:configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/welcome/config_usage.gif)
+ From the general toolbar, please use the left-upper slider to change the CPU/CU size:
  ![screen:configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/simulator/simulator013.jpg)


### WepSIM and its 'State Management'

+ The values of every visible hardware element is the state in a clock cycle. WepSIM has also a 'state management' dialog where users can see the current state, and check the differences between two states.
+ From the execution toolbar, please click over the 'state' button to show the state manager dialog:
     ![screen:configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wepsim/wepsim/master/images/welcome/states_usage.gif)


## Getting Started: Command Line

### Run (and print the final state)

+ From the command line it is possible to 'run' the 's1e1.asm' assembly for the 'ep' architecture with the 'mc-ep_base.txt' microcode, and print the final state:

```bash
./wepsim.sh -a run -m ep -f ./repo/microcode/mips/mc-ep_base.txt -s ./repo/assembly/mips/s1e1.asm
register R2 = 0x2; register R3 = 0x1; register R5 = 0x1; register R29 = 0xfffff; register PC = 0x8018; memory 0x8000 = 0x8400002; memory 0x8004 = 0x8600001; memory 0x8008 = 0xa21809; memory 0x800c = 0x8400002; memory 0x8010 = 0x8600001; memory 0x8014 = 0xa2180a;
```

### Run step by step

+ It is also possible to 'run' 'step by step' the 's1_e1.asm' assembly for the 'ep' architecture with the 'mc-ep_base.txt' microcode, and print for each assembly instruction the state elements that modify its value:

```bash
./wepsim.sh -a stepbystep -m ep -f ./repo/microcode/mips/ep_base.mc -s ./repo/assembly/mips/s1e1.asm
pc,		instruction,			changes_from_zero_or_current_value
pc = 0x8000,	li $2 2,			register R2 = 0x2; register R29 = 0xfffff; register PC = 0x8004
pc = 0x8004,	li $3 1,			register R3 = 0x1; register PC = 0x8008
pc = 0x8008,	add $5 $2 $3,			register R5 = 0x3; register PC = 0x800c
pc = 0x800c,	li $2 2,			register PC = 0x8010
pc = 0x8010,	li $3 1,			register PC = 0x8014
pc = 0x8014,	sub $5 $2 $3,			register R5 = 0x1; register PC = 0x8018
```

### Run microstep by microstep

+ And to 'run' 'microstep by microstep' the 's1e1.asm' assembly for the 'ep' architecture with the 'ep_base.mc' microcode, and print for each microinstruction the state elements that modify its value:

```bash
./wepsim.sh -a microstepbymicrostep -m ep -f ./repo/microcode/mips/ep_base.mc -s ./repo/assembly/mips/s1e1.asm
micropc,		microcode,				changes_from_zero_or_current_value
micropc = 0x0,		T2 C0,					
micropc = 0x1,		TA R BW=11 M1 C1,				
micropc = 0x2,		M2 C2 T1 C3,				register PC = 0x8004
micropc = 0x3,		A0 B=0 C=0,				
micropc = 0x67,		SE OFFSET=0 SIZE=10000 T3 LC MR=0 SELC=10101 A0 B C=0,register R2 = 0x2; register R29 = 0xfffff
micropc = 0x0,		T2 C0,					
micropc = 0x1,		TA R BW=11 M1 C1,				
micropc = 0x2,		M2 C2 T1 C3,				register PC = 0x8008
micropc = 0x3,		A0 B=0 C=0,				
micropc = 0x67,		SE OFFSET=0 SIZE=10000 T3 LC MR=0 SELC=10101 A0 B C=0,register R3 = 0x1
micropc = 0x0,		T2 C0,					
micropc = 0x1,		TA R BW=11 M1 C1,				
micropc = 0x2,		M2 C2 T1 C3,				register PC = 0x800c
micropc = 0x3,		A0 B=0 C=0,				
micropc = 0x35,		MC MR=0 SELA=1011 SELB=10000 MA=0 MB=0 SELCOP=1010 T6 SELC=10101 LC SELP=11 M7 C7 A0 B C=0,register R5 = 0x3
```

### Run & check end state (example when o.k.)

+ You can check if the state at the end of the execution is the same as the one stored on file 'cl-s1e1.txt'. You can 'run' the 's1e1.asm' assembly for the 'ep' architecture with the 'ep_base.mc' microcode (**and if it matches the expected state, then the output is going to be**):

```bash
./wepsim.sh -a check -m ep -f ./repo/microcode/mips/ep_base.mc -s ./repo/assembly/mips/s1e1.asm -r ./repo/checklist/mips/cl-s1e1.txt
OK: Execution: no error reported
```

### Run & check end state (example when k.o.)

+ You can check if the state at the end of the execution is the same as the one stored on file 'cl-s1e1.txt'. You can 'run' the 's1e1.asm' assembly for the 'ep' architecture with the 'ep_base.mc' microcode (**and if it fails to match the expected state then the output is going to be**):

```bash
./wepsim.sh -a check -m ep -f ./repo/microcode/mips/ep_base.mc -s ./repo/assembly/mips/s1e1.asm -r ./repo/checklist/mips/cl-s1e2.txt
ERROR: Execution: different results: cpu[R1]='0' (expected '0xf'), cpu[R2]='0x2' (expected '0xf'), cpu[R3]='0' (expected '0x1'), cpu[R29]='0x100000' (expected '0xfffff'), cpu[PC]='0x8078' (expected '0x8018'), memory[0x1000]='0' (expected '0xa07ff0f'), memory[0x1004]='0' (expected '0x10061'), memory[0x1008]='0' (expected '0x7ffff'), memory[0x100c]='0' (expected '0x61000a'), memory[0x1010]='0' (expected '0xf'), memory[0x1014]='0' (expected '0xffffffff'), memory[0x1018]='0' (expected '0x7'), memory[0x101c]='0' (expected '0x12345678'), memory[0x1020]='0' (expected '0x61'), memory[0x1024]='0' (expected '0x6c6c6568'), memory[0x1028]='0' (expected '0x726f776f'), memory[0x102c]='0' (expected '0x646c'), memory[0x8000]='0x8400002' (expected '0x20201000'), memory[0x8004]='0x8600001' (expected '0x10601010'), memory[0x8008]='0xa21809' (expected '0x820000f'), memory[0x800c]='0x8400002' (expected '0x24201000'), memory[0x8010]='0x8600001' (expected '0x840000f'), memory[0x8014]='0xa2180a' (expected '0x14401010'),
```
